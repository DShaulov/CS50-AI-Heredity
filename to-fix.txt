Your program does not (CALCULATE?) the majority of cases where a gene/trait is present/absent in families with single/multiple children correctly. Do review the specification for how to calculate in all of these scenarios!

- Something is wrong with the way i compute the joint probability?
- I forgot to compute certain cases?

Problem: Calculating the odds of Harry (child with known parents) incorrectly, parents are correct:
- what calculations affect only harry?
    - its wierd because it a joint probability and should affect everyone?
